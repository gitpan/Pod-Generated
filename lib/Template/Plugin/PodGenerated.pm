=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a plugin for the L<Template> Toolkit that you can use to generate POD
documentation during C<make> time.

To understand the concepts behind this, please read the documetation of
L<Module::Install::Template> and C<Pod::Generated>.

When this plugin is loaded in a template - using C<USE p = PodGenerated>, for
example - it evaluates the template's source code - which it has by magic of
L<Module::Install::Template> - so it gives participating modules a chance to
generate documentation. For example, if your module uses
L<Class::Accessor::Complex>, documentation for the generated accessors will be
generated during this time.

This plugin provides the following methods to be used in templates:

=over 4

=item package

The current package name as parsed from the source code.

=item write_inheritance

Information about which classes the current class inherits from and which
methods it inherites, as far as known. Only those methods in superclasses for
which documentation has also been generated are found through this mechanism.

This might be improved at some point.

=item write_methods

Write the documentation for the methods in the current package that have
documentation defined for it.

=back

=head1 TAGS

If you talk about this module in blogs, on del.icio.us or anywhere else,
please use the C<podgenerated> tag.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-pod-generated@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
